# Laurent VAYLET

## Summary

I am a Senior DevOps and Cloud Architect, specializing on Big Data and Machine Learning projects on GCP.

A 2x GCP Certified Professional (Cloud Architect and Data Engineer), I have been accumulating working experience on Google Cloud Platform since mid-2018.

Beyond general software engineering, DevOps and cloud architecture, I specialize in applying DevOps principles to data processing (DataOps) and data science project (MLOps). For example with Kubeflow, the open source Machine Learning toolkit for Kubernetes. Thanks to working hand in hand with Data Engineers and Data Scientists on a daily basis, I understand their expectations and the challenges they face.

## Work Experience

### Cloud Partner Engineer @ Google

*Jun 2020 â€“ Present*

I help our customers solve their biggest problems and transform their business using the best of Google. I also ensure our partners become the best pre-sales and delivery extension of our Google Cloud business.

### Cloud Architect | DevOps @ Groupe Renault

*Mar 2020 â€“ May 2020*

I help Renault scale and modernize its technical stack by:
- migrating the GCP Infrastructure-as-Code from Terraform 11 to Terraform 12
- creating a Terraform module that lets end-users provision firewall rules in a critical GCP project with a self-service approach (compared to a centralized, slow and less secure approach before)
- improving the security of the provisioning processes with terraform-validator and custom security policies/constraints
- automating the generation and storage of sensitive GCP credentials in Vault (compared to a mostly manual workflow based on GitLab CI variables before)
- coaching project teams and operational teams on the value of Cloud, DevOps and MLOps.

### Cloud & Data Architect, specializing on MLOps @ Renault Digital

*Sep 2018 â€“ Feb 2020*

Working hand in hand with Data Scientists and Data Engineers, I contribute to applying DevOps principles to the world of Big Data, Machine Learning and Data Analytics. I focus on production readiness, end-to-end automated deployment and minimum time-to-market.

I am currently involved in:
- Prototyping Kubeflow, the "Machine Learning Toolkit for Kubernetes", in collaboration with Product Managers and Machine Learning Specialists at Google
- Migrating our corporate on-premise Hadoop datalake to GCP
- Defining corporate guidelines regarding data sharing, data governance, authentication and
authorization at the organization level
- Automating the provisioning of sandbox, development and production environments on GCP for project teams
- Developing pilots of Data Science use cases with Data Scientists and Data Engineers
- Consulting Data Scientists and Data Engineers on Cloud, DevOps (MLOps) and architecture topics
